This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's formative essay on the Philosophy of Science module at King's College London. 

The essay argues Bayesianism is elegant and useful in principle, but the problem of the priors undermines its reliabilitiy. Without justified priors, confirmation results can be arbitrary or circular, therefore Bayesian confirmation theory fails to provide a fully satisfactory account of confirmation.
